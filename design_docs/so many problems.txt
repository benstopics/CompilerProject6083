statement while loops won't work
optional parsing methods won't work with boolean, or will they?
methods will have to return true / false?
no, won't work, instead return token.
If token type is null, first token not found.
If token type is production_parsed, a production was parsed successfully
If token type is error, first token found began but production was not parsed

TODO: change parse_token_by_str and parse_token_by_type to reflect these standards
TODO: replace all instances of "!= Token.Types.error" with "!= Token.Types.null" where applicable

boolean return does not work in general with all parsing methods

TODO: change all parsing methods to reflect these standards
TODO: replace all boolean conditions with token type equality conditions for all parsing methods
