When does scope increment or decrement?

Scope increments when it enters a scope:
	for loop
	procedure declaration
	main program

What then does a symbol have in the symbol table?
	name
	scope
	type (string, bool, int, float, procedure definition)

symbol ->
	global variable ->
		array
	local variable ->
		array
	procedure declaration ->
